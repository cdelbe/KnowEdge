Transcluding a tiddler using a template can be used to get limited Wikitext macros.

The limitations are

# You can only have one parameter.
# You can't have default parameters.

So if one parameter is sufficient for your macro, here is how to do it.

First create a tiddler containing your macro, but also add a macro invocation to it. Here is an example:

{{mysimplesamplemacro||code}}

Now all you need to do is, to write `{{parameter||macroname}}`. So for this example:
`{{Bugs Bunny||mysimplesamplemacro}}`

Which renders as:

<<<
{{Bugs Bunny||mysimplesamplemacro}}
<<<

P.S.: Of course: For this little macro a simple

```
Hi my name is <$view field="title"/>!
```

Would have been sufficient. But as soon as the "parameter" is to be used elsewhere, like for example in the [[showtag]] macro-tiddler, which is explained in [[Displaying Tags]], a macro is required.
