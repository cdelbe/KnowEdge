!Definition

An IRT2PL model predicts the probability that a learner will answer an item correctly based on their ability.

𝑝𝑖𝑗(𝜃𝑗) = 1 / 1 + 𝑒−𝑎𝑖(𝜃𝑗−𝑏𝑖)

There are two parameters to the model: ''difficulty'' and ''discrimination''.

* The difficulty is the ability level at which a learner has exactly a 50% chance of answering the question correctly.
* The discrimination measures the ability of the function to distinguish between learners who will pass and those who will fail. It can be viewed as a measure of how accurately the model reflects the data.
